## Project Overview
In this project, we dealt with a large dataset of the most popular songs of Spotify in 2023. We wanted to predict the popularity of these songs using various features, such as audio features (e.g., tempo, danceability, energy) and platform-specific data (e.g., playlist status, chart positions).

We trained and tested two machine learning models:

- Random Forest: An ensemble model based on bagging.

- Gradient Boosting: A boosting-based ensemble model.

We evaluated the models after training them with the R¬≤ score to determine how accurately each model could predict song popularity. We also conducted a feature importance analysis to determine which features contribute the most to a song's popularity.

## üìä Dataset
The [dataset](dataset/spotify-2023.csv) used for this project is complete information on Spotify's top hit songs for the year 2023. It is a combination of audio features extracted from Spotify's API and platform-specific metadata such as playlist status and chart position.

### Key components of the dataset  

- **Audio Features (from Spotify API)**:  
  - `danceability`: How suitable a track is for dancing.
  - `energy` :  Intensity and activity level of a track.
  - `key` : The estimated overall key of the track.
  - `loudness` : Overall loudness in decibels (dB).
  - `mode` : Major or minor scale.
  - `speechiness` : Presence of spoken words.
  - `acousticness` :  Likelihood the track is acoustic.
  - `instrumentalness` : Predicts whether a track contains vocals.
  - `liveness` : Detects the presence of an audience.
  - `valence` : Musical positivity.
  - `tempo` : Speed or pace of the track in BPM.
- **Platform Metadata**:
  - `in_spotify_charts` : Whether the song appeared on Spotify Charts.
  - `in_apple_charts` : Whether the song appeared on Apple Music Charts.
  - `in_deezer_charts` : Whether the song appeared on Deezer Charts.
  - `in_shazam_charts` : Whether the song appeared on Shazam Charts.
  - `in_spotify_playlists` : Presence in Spotify editorial/user playlists.
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Source of the Dataset
The dataset appears to have been compiled from multiple streaming and analytics platforms, likely through web scraping or API access.
The original source of the dataset is : [Spotify 2023 Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)
If you want to see the details of the dataset I would certainly recommend the website.

  ```

## Model Evaluation  
The performance of the models was compared using the R¬≤ score. Summary of results:
- **Gradient Boosting**: Had an R¬≤ score of 0.8679, meaning that it was better at capturing complex relationships in the data.
- **Random Forest**: Had an R¬≤ score of 0.8377.
Feature importance calculation showed that platform-related features (e.g., playlist status, chart positions) were the crucial determinants that determined the popularity of the songs.
