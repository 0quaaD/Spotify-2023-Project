st.markdown("""**In this project, we explored a huge dataset of Spotify's hit songs of 2023 and attempted to forecast their popularity based on features of different music platforms and audio features. We have trained and tested two ensemble models ‚Äî Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ‚Äî to evaluate their prediction abilities.

The results showed that the Gradient Boosting model outperformed the Random Forest model with a higher R2R2 value of 0.8679 compared to 0.8377. This indicates that Gradient Boosting was superior at capturing the complex relationships within the dataset.

Both models are trained on identical feature sets and so it was reasonable to make the comparison. Feature importance plots also provide insight into which fields (e.g., playlist status and platform charts) are playing most significant roles towards making the song popular. 

Lesson: In this case, Gradient Boosting is a better method than predicting song popularity, and perhaps could be optimised or worked further upon in the future with improved performance.**""")
